# RaspberryPi GPIO Experiments

This is a repository for my Raspberry Pi GPIO experiments.

If you're a beginner, just like me, this may be very helpful.


## About the Experiments

Each experiment has a single folder containing all the related diagrams, a list of needed materials and code files. I will also write a simple README.md file for each one of them explaining interesting details.

In some cases I will even post a cool picture of the completed project.

If you have any doubts or suggestions feel free to use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/lucasfcosta/raspberry-gpio-experiments/issues) to get in touch with me.


## My Setup

Currently I'm using a RaspberryPi 2 Model B for these experiments.
If you are using one of these too take a look at the pinout diagram below so you can get to know what each pin does.

If you're using a different board just Google "your_board_name pinout" and you will certainly find the information you want.


## Useful Material

### [Practical Electronics for Inventors](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Third-Edition/dp/0071771336)

This book provides you everything you need to know to start exploring electronics in general. It goes all the way through the basics until advanced knowledge to build things for the real world. Buy this, you won't regret.


### [123D Circuits](https://123d.circuits.io/)

This is an excelent online tool for you to build and test your circuits.
It doesn't have many available components, but you will be amazed with it's simulation feature. **Highly recommended for beginners**. Most of the diagrams made in this repository were made with this tool.


### [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org)

I highly recomend you to use [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org) to create sketches and diagrams. Some of the diagrams in this repository were made using this software.
