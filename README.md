# RaspberryPi GPIO Experiments

This is a repository for my Raspberry Pi GPIO experiments.

If you're a beginner, just like me, this may be very helpful.


## About the Experiments

Each experiment has a single folder containing all the related diagrams, a list of needed materials and code files. I will also write a simple README.md file for each one of them explaining interesting details.

In some cases I will even post a cool picture of the completed project.

If you have any doubts or suggestions feel free to use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/lucasfcosta/raspberry-gpio-experiments/issues) to get in touch with me.


## My Setup

Currently I'm using a RaspberryPi 2 Model B for these experiments.
If you are using one of these too take a look at the pinout diagram below so you can get to know what each pin does.

If you're using a different board just Google "your_board_name pinout" and you will certainly find the information you want.
